           Health care management encompasses the efforts involved in planning, 
           directing, and coordinating nonclinical activities within health care systems, 
           organizations, and networks. This is a very focused branch of management that 
           requires specific knowledge of health care operations and technology along with soft skills such as the ability to motivate team members,
           collaborate with multiple stakeholders, and proactively implement needed changes.</div>
